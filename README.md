(Doing Role Based Project Development)

- src/
    - config/ (to store database configuration)
    - controllers/
    - middlewares/
    - models/
    - repository/
    - services/
    - util/ (extra utility functions, helper functions)
    - index.js (main server file)
- tests/ [will be created later]
- static/

- Will be deploying project later, at that time uploading tests folder will create extra burden on server...therefore making seperate folders
